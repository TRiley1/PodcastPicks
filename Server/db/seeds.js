				"description": "In the gruelling world of elite gymnastics, Larry Nassar was seen by a lot of young athletes as a friendly face in tough times. As the USA Gymnastics National Medical Coordinator, he performed treatments on children as young as ten, for almost 30 years.¬†  And under cover of those treatments, he was routinely molesting hundreds of young girls for decades ‚Äì sometimes multiple times a day, often with their parents sitting just metres away.  After multiple investigations, he seemed untouchable. But thanks to the bravery of his survivors ‚Äì and the discovery of three external hard drives ‚Äì the world saw him for what he really was: a calculated predator, with more victims than Bill Cosby, Jerry Sandusky and Harvey Weinstein combined.

As the USA Gymnastics National Medical Coordinator, he performed treatments on children as young as ten, for almost 30 years.¬†<br /><br/><br /><br/>And under cover of those treatments, he was routinely molesting hundreds of young girls for decades ‚Äì sometimes multiple times a day, often with their parents sitting just metres away.<br /><br/><br /><br/>After multiple investigations, he seemed untouchable. But thanks to the bravery of his survivors ‚Äì and the discovery of three external hard drives ‚Äì the world saw him for what he really was: a calculated predator, with more victims than Bill Cosby, Jerry Sandusky and Harvey Weinstein combined.

				"description": "In October of 2019, prison officers at HMP Full Sutton in West Yorkshire discovered the body of a prisoner who'd been subjected to 89 minutes of torture before being strangled to death by another inmate.   The victim was 33-year-old Richard Huckle.   Dubbed by the media as \"The Gap Year Paedophile\", Huckle was serving a life sentence for carrying out a 9-year-long, systematic campaign of abuse against some of the world's poorest children.   Huckle documented his atrocities on the dark web, authored a how-to-guide for paedophiles, and contributed to one of the largest nonce-networks ever discovered.   This is the story of Richard Huckle and the incredible officers who brought him down.
